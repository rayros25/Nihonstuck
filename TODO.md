# Style issues
## Act 1
## Act 2
* Page 655: Something going on with colons. Actually wait. Is this all of Act 2?
## Act 3
* page 845: maybe turn this (and other Rose GameFAQs) into an image (also translate link maybe)
## Intermission

## Act 5
* Missing translation notes
* Maybe think of putting spaces for nepeta, cuz right now it's AC::33
    * Equius too, right now he's CG:D -->
    * Should we use romaji here instead?
* Are we using the same colon throughout? I don't think it matters but
* Romaji vs ASCII letters
* Are some of the pesterlogs missing the "began pestering" part?
* Maybe add some furigana (e.g. page 444)
