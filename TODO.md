# Missing things
* Some pages were untranslated
* Proper links (to media, to Google, to exiles)

# Style issues
* Page 20: add the links to those Con Air clips like it is in the OG
* Page 226: lt and gt are not showing up. Also laptop is lowercase here
* Page 228: Grimoire is normal caps
* Page 249: ASCII is misspelled as ASCLL
* Page 256: TT is entirely kanji here
* Page 267: ==> is small?
* Page 319: Colors are missing from "BOX". This is true for all hashing (they show up at 589)
* Page 510: Links are missing?
* Page 612: Make sure ths SBAHJ reference comes through
* Page 655: Something going on with colons
* Page 829: Pesterchum handles need furigana halfway through
* Page 915: sbahj?
* Page 934: ectobiology is written in katakana
* Page 953: Typo. (also how should this be formatted)
* Page 1000: What translation for ghostyTrickster?
* Page 1114: Off-by-one error?
* Act 3: Add colors to birthday letters
* Intermission: missing DZ's translator notes. Search using (ï¼‘)
* Are we using the same colon throughout? I don't think it matters but
* Romaji vs ASCII letters
* "Bolding" is dropped as a replacement of all caps
* Are some of the pesterlogs missing the "began pestering" part?
* Maybe add some furigana (e.g. page 444)
* How do we spell Beta referring to the Homestuck beta?
